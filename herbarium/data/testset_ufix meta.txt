1) 250 herbarium specimen images were put through Google Cloud Vision (GCV) for text capture.
2) Results were manually validated line by line for correctness. Some elements were ignored, such as text on the color bar and ruler.
3) A gold standard was created for all unignored elements. These are published in a JSON format along with their bounding boxes.
4) Bounding boxes were defined differently than the lines (which were newline separated). This causes the granularity of the GCV-provided bounding boxes
to be greater than the values in the Gold Standard. Hence, the GCV boxes were merged to conform to the gold standard values.
5) Ignored values still have a bounding box, just no gold standard. Text missed by GCV does not have bounding boxes.

Metadata of the .json file:
(Note that empty fields are omitted from the JSON)

goldstandard:gcv	raw transcription by GCV, separated by newline characters.
goldstandard:gold	gold standard as approximated by manual validators
goldstandard:ignored	checked (with x) if this line was ignored for validation
goldstandard:unint	checked (with x) if this line was considered to be unintelligible
goldstandard:comment	free text comments by the validators
goldstandard:id	numeric id for the line in the gold standard
goldstandard:bb	bounding box for the gold standard (or ignored) line
golstandard:ht	whether the line was typed (t), handwritten (h) or a combination of both (ht). for the latter category, (th) may also be used erroneously.
goldstandard:score	line accuracy score of 0, 0.5 or 1. 0,5 may occur as well.
